# Rosetta & Philae's Adventure #

Now that the Rosetta mission is coming to an end I feel quite sad.
Thanks to the beautiful cartoons made, I found myself growing emotionally attached to these two robots.
I don't want to say goodbye to them :(
So I decided to make this little tribute to thank ESA for sharing this mission with us in such a lovely way!
